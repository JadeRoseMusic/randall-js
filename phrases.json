     "All there is is a man, a rod, a lake and a fish. And it all starts with a hand-dug American worm.",
     "You and your worms are fishing in the past, Hank, in the days of black-and-white television and a democratically elected Congress.",
     "Man, that's quick, man, talkin' 'bout Hank's the man, man, dang ol' fishin' magician, man.",
     "Well, now, this is the dangdest thing. This is the same fish I just threw back.",
     "That's it! I'm going fishing!",
     "Come on, take the bait, you know you want it.",
     "Gribble, this fish is frozen.",
     "the icing on the cake is when God smiles on you and you hook one. And then when you're reeling it in, everything else falls away. You don't think about taxes or traffic or that pushy gal that's trying to get into the Citadel or who's going to take care of you when your mother and I are old and incapacitated.",
     "We don't fish for the fish. Ninety percent of what I like about this sport -- and it is a sport -- is sitting in the boat doing nothing."
